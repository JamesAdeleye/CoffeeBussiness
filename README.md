# CoffeeBussiness
This is a webpage created for a coffee shop. If you want to see the live webpage download and run the code in visual studio code. NOTE: The code is adapted from my tutor on YouTube. However, I am going to make it dynamic by adding JavaScript to take customer order. This is ongoing. Download all the files including the 'images' folder unzip it and put everthing in a singular folder "CoffeeBussiness".
